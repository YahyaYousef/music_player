## State Management with Get

This project uses the Get package for state management. Here are some reasons why Get is chosen:

*   **Simplicity**: Get provides a simple API for managing state without the need for complex setups.
*   **Reactive Programming**: Get leverages reactive programming, making it easy to update the UI in response to changes in the application state.
*   **Dependency Injection**: Get includes a built-in dependency injection system, simplifying the management of dependencies in the app.
*   **Navigation Management**: Get offers a convenient way to handle navigation between screens.
